# Exoplanet analysis

This workshop on exoplanets will be a self driven workshop. By that we mean, we will introduce some useful tools for doing exoplanet research which you can then use to learn more about the topic by getting hands on analysis experience.

Even if you do not research exoplanets, this workshop will be useful to you, especially in terms of visualising your data.
