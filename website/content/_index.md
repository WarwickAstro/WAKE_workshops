## Dr. Paul Strøm
### Assistant Professor at the University of Warwick

I work on the ESA [PLATO space mission](https://sci.esa.int/web/plato) which is designed to find small, rocky exoplanets in the habitable zones of stars like the Sun.

For my research, I work on single transit exoplanets and exocomets.

I am the PI of the [Warwick Astronomy Knowledge Exchange (WAKE)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/research/wake/) which is aimed at increasing the diversity within the astronomy group at Warwick.
