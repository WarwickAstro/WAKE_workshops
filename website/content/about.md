## My Science

### Exocomets
Exocomets are small icy bodies, which orbit stars other than the Sun and sublimate when close to their star, producing a tail of dust and gas (like solar system comets). During transit, the gas causes spectroscopic absorption signatures that are routinely detected. The most prolific case is beta Pic, which continuously displays narrow, variable, absorption features superimposed on the much broader stellar lines. The features vary on short timescales (hours) and are seen at optical (e.g. CaII) and UV (e.g. FeII, SiIV) wavelengths.
